<description brief="SSH library for Python">
This package contains a redistribution of the paramiko library by Robey Pointer. It has been modified to restructure Python source files to ROS package conventions and files relating to installing paramiko using easy_install have been removed to eliminate confusion. 

Unaltered distribution can be downloaded from: 
    http://www.lag.net/paramiko/download/paramiko-1.7.1.zip

Paramiko is a library for making SSH2 connections (client or server).
Emphasis is on using SSH2 as an alternative to SSL for making secure
connections between python scripts.  All major ciphers and hash methods
are supported.  SFTP client and server mode are both supported too.
        
Required packages:
pyCrypto
