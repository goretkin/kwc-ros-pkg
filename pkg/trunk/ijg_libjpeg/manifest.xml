<description brief="The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software">

This package is a just a wrapper around the standard distribution of the IJG
JPEG software, version 6b. This library is mature, widely used, and is present
in many Linux distributions as "libjpeg." I have wrapped it as a ROS package
just to simplify installation and dependency generation within ROS. This ROS
package also includes a trivial library which provides a mutex for wrapping
calls to libjpeg, as libjpeg is not thread-safe due to its use of jumps for
error handling.
