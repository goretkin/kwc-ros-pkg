\section{Overview}
litTF is designed to provide a simple interface for keeping track 
of coordinate transforms within a robotic framework.  
A simple case which was one of the driving design considerations was
the use of a sensor on an actuated platform.  In this case the sensor
will report data in the frame of the moving platform, but the data is much 
more useful in the world frame. To provide the transform libTF will be told 
the position of the platform periodically as it moves.  And when prompted libTF can 
provide the transform from the sensor frame to the world frame at the time when the
sensor data was acquired.  Not only will libTF will keep track of the transform between 
two coordinate frames, but it will also keep track of a whole tree of coordinate frames, 
and automatically chain transformations together between any two connected frames.  

\section{Transform Library}

\subsection{Terminology and Conventions}
\paragraph {Coodinate Frame}
In this documentation the default 
will be a right handed system with X forward, Y left and Z up. 

\paragraph {Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters (DH Parameters)}
DH Parameters are a way to concicely represent a rigid body tranformation in three dimentions.  
It has four parameters: length, twist, offset, and angle.  In addition to using the optimal 
amount of data to store the transformation, there are also optimized methods of chaining 
transformations together.  And lastly the parameters can directly represent rotary and prismatic
joints found on robotic arms.  
See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit-Hartenberg_Parameters} for more details.

\paragraph {Euler Angles}
For this library Euler angles are considered to be translations in x, y, z, followed by a rotation around z, y, x.
With the respective angular changes referred to as yaw, pitch and roll. 

\paragraph {Homogeneous Transformation Matrix}
Homogeneous Transformation Matrices are a simple way to manipulate 3D translations and rotations 
with standard matrix multiplication.  It is a composite of a standard 3x3 rotation matrix
(see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix}) and a translation vector.  

Let $_1R_0$ be the 3x3 rotation matrix defined by the Euler angles $(yaw_0,pitch_0,roll_0)$ 
and let $_1T_0$ be the column vector $(x_0,y_0,z_0)^T$ representing the translation.  The combination 
of these two transformations results in the transformation of reference frame 0 to reference frame 1.

A point P in frame 1, $P_1$, can be transformed into frame 1, $P_0$, by the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HT}
\begin{pmatrix}
P_0 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
_0R_1 & _0T_1 \\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
P_1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The net result is a 4x4 transformation matrix which does both the rotation and translation 
between coordinate frames. The basic approach is to use a 4x1 vector consisting of $(x,y,z,1)^T_1$ 
and by left multiplying by $_0A_1$ it will result in $(x',y',z',1)^T_1$.

The matrix library used within this library is Newmat10.


\paragraph {Newmat10}
Newmat10 is the matrix library used in this library.  Documentation for Newmat can be found at
