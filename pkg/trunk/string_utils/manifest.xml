  <description brief="String Utilities">

    This package provides a simple static library which makes dealing
    with strings in C++ a bit less of a headache. This includes tokenizer 
    wrappers, etc. I suppose we could add utilities for other languages
    in here, but most modern languages seem to have nice string stuff
    provided already.
