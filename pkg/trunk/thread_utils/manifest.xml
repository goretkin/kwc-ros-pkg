  <description brief="Thread Utilities">

    This package provides a simple static library which makes dealing with
    threads in C++ a bit less of a headache. This includes cross-platform
    wrappers for mutexes, etc. I suppose we could add utilities for other
    languages in here, but most modern languages seem to have nice
    cross-platform thread stuff already.
