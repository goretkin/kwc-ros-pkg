<description brief="C++ Matrix Library">

(from the website:)

This C++ library is intended for scientists and engineers who need to manipulate a variety of types of matrices using standard matrix operations. Emphasis is on the kind of operations needed in statistical calculations such as least squares, linear equation solve and eigenvalues. 

This ROS package also supplies a small patch which enables namespaces and streams.
