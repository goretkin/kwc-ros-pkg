libdc1394 is a library that provides a complete high level application programming interface (API) for developers who wish to control IEEE 1394 based cameras that conform to the 1394-based Digital Camera Specifications (also known as the IIDC or DCAM Specifications). The library currently works on Linux, Mac OSX and (soon) Windows.
