<description brief="Controlling and acquiring data from Axis IP-based cameras">

There are many ways to get images out of Axis IP-based cameras. The simplest is
to just call 'wget' over and over. This is what the 'axis_cam_wget' and
'axis_cam_wget_polled' programs do.

In the future, I may add more sophisticated (more efficient) transport methods.
