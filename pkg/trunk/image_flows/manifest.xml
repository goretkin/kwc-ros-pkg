  <description brief="Flows carrying images">

    This package contains serialization/deserialization for images, and handy
    libraries to compress/decompress them. The image flow itself is just a
    binary byte block. It is up to the sender and receiver to decide what goes
    in the byte block. This package supplies a library that makes it easy to do
    this. This library is just provided in C++ for now, but could be ported
    relatively easily to more modern languages, since many of them have image
    compression codecs built-in.
